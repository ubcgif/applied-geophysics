:::{important} UBC-GIF Research Group
Our research group advances numerical methods in simulations, inversions, and machine learning. We work on problems in resource exploration, management and environmental applications, foster open science practices, and train the next generation of geoscientists.
:::

## Our Focus

Applications
: Mineral exploration, permafrost, groundwater, unexploded ordinance (UXO), geotechnical engineering, carbon capture and storage, geothermal.

Data
: Electrical and electromagnetic methods, induced polarization, gravity and magnetics, petrophysical and geologic data.

Methods
: Numerical simulations of partial differential equations, optimization techniques, inverse theory, machine learning, open source software.

## Research Consortia

Our research is supported by the Geophysics Inversion Consortium. Our members have access to researchers, private educational materials, and the ability to work with our research group to create research priorities.
